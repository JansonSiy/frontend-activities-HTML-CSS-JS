            <p>
                But must I explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a
                complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
                human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
                how to pursue pleasure rationally encounte consequences that are extermely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because ocassionally circumstances occur in which toil and
                pain can procure hime some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
                except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
                has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we de-
                nounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
                moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
